# -- User Settings -- #
# Run as unprivileged arbiter for security
User=arbiter
# Enable cgroup accounting by running in user.slice, instead of system.slice (default with Slice=)
# TODO: Lookup uid of arbiter and put it here. Systemd's %U variable may work for system accounts

# Allows for Arbiter2 to use pss in /proc/<pid>/smaps (assuming pss = true in the
# config), typically you'd use "CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_SYS_PTRACE", but this
# only works on binaries. Ambient allows for interpreted programs (python) to
# still use these capabilities. See the install guide for more info.
